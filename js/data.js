					<p>As for image hosting, we used a free service, <a href='http://cloudinary.com/' target=\"_blank\">cloudinary</a>, and link it to our website. This is an unique experience as we have to hack around the service to search for an image hosting service whose image url can be retrieved. Our mongodb only stores the urlstring to the image.</p>\
					<p>We also implemented a basic rating system and an admin who needs to approve posts to elevate their popularity.</p>\
					<p>Unfortunately, a similar service has been put in place and the judges deem that our project lack UX. Despite all of these, I personally feel that we have made quite an application in under 48 hours.</p>\
