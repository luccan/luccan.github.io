				Windows has employed a very neat IP network architecture abstraction in its Web Service.</br>
				For a simple web application, deployment is as easy as adding a new WebApps service and publishing your content from home.</br>

				However, when your web application starts to deal with vendors, you have a problem.
				Some data vendors request your server's IP address to be whitelisted by their server.
				Window's network architecture made a WebApps IP regional.
				This means that anyone in the region will have the same 4 Public IP.
				Definitely, this is not ideal for our needs.

				While Windows has these solutions:
				- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-app-service-environment-intro/
				- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-how-to-create-an-app-service-environment/
				They can be too pricey for a small-to-medium scale web application.

				The solution is to give up on trying to configure Static IP for your Web App's Webjobs.
				Instead, create an application, or a windows service, in an azure VM.
				Resources to reserving IPs for a VM is easy to find.

				> New-AzureReservedIP -ReservedIPName <Reserved IP Name> -Location "Southeast Asia"
				> Get-AzureVM -Name <VM Name> -ServiceName <service name> | Set-AzureReservedIPAssociation -ReservedIPName <Reserved IP Name>

				Do note that reserved IPs may change if you transfer ownership.
				Consider using public IP if you may need to hand over development.
