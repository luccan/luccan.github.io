				Windows has employed a very neat IP network architecture abstraction in its Web Service.<br/>
				For a simple web application, deployment is as easy as adding a new WebApps service and publishing your content from home.<br/>
				<br/>
				However, when your web application starts to deal with vendors, you have a problem.<br/>
				Some data vendors request your server's IP address to be whitelisted by their server.<br/>
				Window's network architecture made a WebApps IP regional.<br/>
				This means that anyone in the region will have the same 4 Public IP.<br/>
				Definitely, this is not ideal for our needs.<br/>
				<br/>
				While Windows has these solutions:<br/>
				- <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-app-service-environment-intro/">App Service Environment Intro</a><br/>
				- <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-how-to-create-an-app-service-environment/">How to Create an App Service Environment</a><br/>
				They can be too pricey for a small-to-medium scale web application.<br/>
				<br/>
				The solution is to give up on trying to configure Static IP for your Web App's Webjobs.<br/>
				Instead, create an application, or a windows service, in an azure VM.<br/>
				Resources to reserving IPs for a VM is easy to find.<br/>
				<br/>

				Do note that reserved IPs may change if you transfer ownership.<br/>
				Consider using public IP if you may need to hand over development.<br/>
